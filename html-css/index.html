    <p class="summary">React.js, a comprehensive JavaScript library for building user interfaces, has changed the way we think about front-end development. React.js has grasped the interest of the open source community and it is here to stay. However, the nuances and idiosyncrasies of React.js require extra caution when distinguishing between good JavaScript developers and true experienced React.js developers.</p><hr><h2>Working Experience</h2><p>if you are unfamiliar with the code’s syntax, don’t worry! The goal of this tutorial is to help you understand React and its syntax.

        We recommend that you check out the tic-tac-toe game before continuing with the tutorial. One of the features that you’ll notice is that there is a numbered list to the right of the game’s board. This list gives you a history of all of the moves that have occurred in the game, and it is updated as the game progresses.
        
        You can close the tic-tac-toe game once you’re familiar with it. We’ll be starting from a simpler template in this tutorial. Our next step is to set you up so that you can start building the game.
