/* Variables are used to store and manipulate data. They provide a way to reference and work with values within your code. 
Variables in JavaScript are dynamically typed, meaning you can assign different types of values to the same variable.
To declare a variable in JavaScript, you can use the var, let, or const keyword:
The var keyword has some scoping quirks and can lead to unexpected behavior. 
It's recommended to use let or const instead.
